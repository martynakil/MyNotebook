<h3>What did I use in the project? What have I learned?</h3>

* I learned the basics of JS here
* I practiced CSS, and most of all [FLEXBOX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
* Arrow and SWITCH functions
* DOM Elements (searching for elements from the DOM : addEventListener, querySelector, getElementsByClassNam)

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

* On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* and then "go live" is enough
